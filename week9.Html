                Welcome and thank you for stopping by my webpage. This is a site dedicated to the top things to do at Disney World and if they are worth it or not. 
                Although somethings can be amazing they can also be ridiculously expensive so we are going to look at and compare everything to decide what is the best
                and what is worth it. Thanks for joining me and I hope you enjoy and learn something.
            </P>
